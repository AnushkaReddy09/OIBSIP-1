Task-1: Online Reservation System

This Java program implements an online seat reservation system with a menu-driven interface. 
Users can view the seat map, reserve seats, cancel reservations, or exit the program. 
The seat map displays the availability of seats, with "X" indicating reserved seats. 
Reservation and cancellation functions prompt users to input seat numbers within the range of 1 to 10, and appropriate messages are displayed based on the user's actions.
